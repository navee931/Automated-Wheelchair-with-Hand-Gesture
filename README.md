# Automated-Wheelchair-with-Hand-Gesture

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of an automated wheelchair prototype that can be controlled using hand gestures and Bluetooth communication. The system is designed to improve mobility and independence for individuals with physical disabilities by providing an intuitive, user-friendly control mechanism.

Instead of relying on traditional joysticks or physical buttons, users can navigate the wheelchair through predefined hand gestures, making control more natural and accessible. Additionally, Bluetooth connectivity allows the wheelchair to be operated remotely using a smartphone or other Bluetooth-enabled devices, offering greater flexibility and convenience.

By integrating gesture recognition and wireless communication, this project demonstrates how modern technology can be applied to assistive devices to enhance usability, comfort, and quality of life.
